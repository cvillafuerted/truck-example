# truck-example

This repository is intended as a hands-on environment for learning and practicing with Trunk, a powerful tool for managing code quality and automation in software projects. The goal of this project is to explore Trunk's features, including its configuration, integration, and workflow enhancements, in a practical and iterative manner.

Here, you will find the initial setup and subsequent changes as part of the process to understand how Trunk can streamline development, enforce best practices, and improve team collaboration. This is the first commit to establish the foundation for further experimentation and learning with Trunk.
